    //object oriented programming is methodology in which everything is represented as an object.
    //oops concepts has four main principle which are followings:
    //1.Inheritance  2.Abstraction 3.Polymorphism  4.Encapsulation.

    //1.Inheritance=Acquiring all the property and method of parent class into child class  is called as inheritance.
    //inheritance has five types .
    // simple inheritance,multiple inheritance,multilevel inheritance,hirechical inheritance,hybrid inheritance.
    //advantages:code reusability.

    //2.Abstraction =abstraction is hiding the internal data and showing the functionality only is called abstraction.
      //using getter and setter method we can archive abstraction.
    //3.Polymorphism=one thing can do in many ways is nothing but polymorphism.
    //method overloading and overriding is type of polymorphism.
    //method overloading =if the method  has same name but different argument is overloading
    //overriding=if the two method has same name with same argument is overriding.

    //4.Encapsulation=Wrapping the all data and code into single unit.
